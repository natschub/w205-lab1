1. EBS is elastic block store provides block stage levels for EC2 instances in the AWS cloud. EBS is for computing instances, S3 is for data storage. \

2. Using cloud infrastructure for data science keeps data separate from your computing instance. If your computing instance fails, you don\'92t worry about losing data because it is not housed on the computing instance. Cloud infrastructure backs up data, further keeping it secure if any hard drive should fail.\
\
